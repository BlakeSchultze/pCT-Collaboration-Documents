\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\scaleobj{1.25}{/}home\scaleobj{1.25}{/}$<$user name$>$}}\color{Black} : On each Kodiak/Tardis node, this is the local home directory of each user where the files controlling user settings/history are stored.  Although the user account settings files (.bash\_profile, .bash\_history, etc.) are automatically distributed to each node so that any preference changes will apply to user sessions on any node, this data is not backed up and there is a limited storage capacity.  Thus, this directory should only be used to store small amounts of temporary data.  These directories are private and only accessible by that user.
\vspace{-5mm}
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\scaleobj{1.25}{/}data\scaleobj{1.25}{/}$\dots$ }}\color{Black} : The data in this directory is located on a network storage device and this drive is mounted on both the Kodiak and Tardis clusters, making it accessible from all of the master/compute nodes.  The contents of this directory are periodically backed up to tape drive from which data/code can be recovered in case of failure.
\vspace{-5mm}
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\scaleobj{1.25}{/}data\scaleobj{1.25}{/}$<$user name$>$ }}\color{Black} : This is the global home directory of each user where the input/output data for code/program execution and all permanent/important personal data should be stored.  As a subdirectory of \scaleobj{1.25}{/}data, the contents of these directories are backed up periodically, but like the local home directories, each user only has access to their personal directory.
\vspace{-5mm}
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\scaleobj{1.25}{/}data\scaleobj{1.25}{/}ion\scaleobj{1.25}{/}$\dots$ }}\color{Black} : This directory is associated with the user ``\textit{ion}'', but unlike the other user directories, it is accessible by all pCT users and all data, code, and documentation is shared by placing it in this directory.  While their is no format/organization imposed on the other user directories, the data bound for this directory must first be organized according to the format outlined in the next section of this document.
\vspace{-5mm}

Once this data is finished being uploaded, it can either be moved to the user's personal directory \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\scaleobj{1.25}{/}data\scaleobj{1.25}{/}$<$user name$>$ }}\color{Black} or if it is immediately ready to share with the other users, it can be organized and moved to the user's staging directory \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\scaleobj{1.25}{/}data\scaleobj{1.25}{/}ion\scaleobj{1.25}{/}staging\scaleobj{1.25}{/}$<$user name$>$.}}\color{Black}

Each type of data is stored in separate subdirectories and soft links to this data are created and organized in a directory hierarchy indicating their input/output data dependencies.  The directory/file naming and organizational scheme for each type of data and the soft links are outlined in the next section of this document.  Data/images should only be moved to this shared directory after having been verified as valid/accurate and having been organized appropriately.

This data must be organized according to the format outlined in this document for data of this type.

\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\scaleobj{1.25}{/}data\scaleobj{1.25}{/}ion\scaleobj{1.25}{/}pCT\_code\scaleobj{1.25}{/}$\dots$ }}\color{Black} : This directory contains the code/programs used to generate simulated pCT data, preprocess raw experimental data, reconstruct images from experimental/simulated data, and tools for analyzing reconstructed images.  This directory also contains the code/program which calculates the water equivalent depth (WED) for a given list of beam angles and beam aim point (BAP) coordinates using the reconstructed RSP values for the target volume.  Each type of program and the corresponding code are stored in separate directories, and for each of these directories there is a ``\textit{master}'' directory containing the code/program that should be used/executed by users.  Each of these directories also contains separate subdirectories for each user involved in the development of the corresponding program and as a subdirectory of \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{$\dots$\scaleobj{1.25}{/}data\scaleobj{1.25}{/}ion}}\color{Black}, this code is then accessible by other users involved in the development of this program, making collaboration with them easier.  Ideally, everyone will manage their code/software development with something like GitHub in which case they could develop code from their personal directory and make their code available to collaborators through GitHub, but this is not a strict requirement (just a strong suggestion).  In cases where there are multiple versions of a program being developed completely separately (as is the case with the preprocessing code and the old/new reconstruction code), there should be a ``\textit{master}'' version for each of these in separate subdirectories with names making these discernable.\\

This is a GitHub managed local repository allowing everyone to ``push'' contributions to the repository and ``pull'' updates/additions from others into their own local clone ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.\\
