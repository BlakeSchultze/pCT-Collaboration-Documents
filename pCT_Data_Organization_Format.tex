\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\dirsep home\dirsep\usernamelabel}}\color{Black} : On each Kodiak/Tardis node, this is the local home directory of each user where the files controlling user settings/history are stored.  Although the user account settings files (.bash\_profile, .bash\_history, etc.) are automatically distributed to each node so that any preference changes will apply to user sessions on any node, this data is not backed up and there is a limited storage capacity.  Thus, this directory should only be used to store small amounts of temporary data.  These directories are private and only accessible by that user.
\vspace{-5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\dirsep data\dirsep\usernamelabel}}\color{Black} : This is the global home directory of each user where the input/output data for code/program execution and all permanent/important personal data should be stored.  As a subdirectory of \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep data}}\color{Black}, the contents of these directories are backed up periodically, but like the local home directories, each user only has access to their personal directory.
\vspace{-5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\dirsep ion\dirsep$\dots$ }}\color{Black} : This directory is dedicated to proton and ion therapy research and contains directories where users can upload data and/or code and selectively share these files with the collaboration by moving the desired files to the staging area (\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep staging\dirsep\usernamelabel}}\color{Black}) from which an administrator will move these to the appropriate data/code directory.  The data in this directory is located on a network storage device and this drive is mounted on both the Kodiak and Tardis clusters, making it accessible from all of the master/compute nodes.  The contents of this directory are periodically backed up to tape drive from which data/code can be recovered in case of failure.
\vspace{-5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\dirsep ion\dirsep incoming\dirsep\usernamelabel}}\color{Black} : This is the directory where users should upload data/code to the Baylor server prior to preparing and organizing it for sharing with the collaboration, with each user only having access to their personal directory in \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep incoming}}\color{Black}.  Data/code that a user wants to share with the collaboration should then be organized appropriately and then moved to their personal directory in the staging area (\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion\dirsep staging\dirsep\usernamelabel}}\color{Black}) from which data/code is moved to a shared directory accessible by the entire collaboration.  In general, users should consider removing data from their incoming directory once it has been added to the staging area and moved to a shared directory to avoid unnecessary duplicate data and memory consumption.
\vspace{-5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\dirsep ion\dirsep staging\dirsep\usernamelabel }}\color{Black} : This is the directory where users should move data/code when it is ready to be shared with the collaboration and contact.  At the moment, users should then notify a cluster administrator (e.g. Brian Sitton, Keith Schubert) when there is data/code ready to be moved to a shared directory, but work will be done to make this a more streamlined process.  Note that administrators typically will not be familiar with pCT or the organizational scheme so it important for the files in the staging area to be organized such that their path below \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion\dirsep staging\dirsep\usernamelabel }}\color{Black} exactly mirrors the path below \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion}}\color{Black} where it is to be moved.  

In other words, the data in the staging directory should be organized into the exact same hierarchy of directories as it is to be organized in the target subdirectory of \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion}}\color{Black}, as defined by the pCT data/code organizational scheme, with the top directory in the staging area corresponding to the first subdirectory of \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion }}\color{Black} along the target path (often \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep pCT\_data }}\color{Black} or \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep pCT\_code}}\color{Black}).  The administrator can then move the data/code to the appropriate target destination by following the target and staging area paths downward from \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion }}\color{Black} and \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{staging\dirsep\usernamelabel }}\color{Black}, respectively, moving data from the staging area to the corresponding target directory as it is encountered.  This is repeated until all files have been moved or a subdirectory along the target path does not exist in the target hierarchy, at which point the missing subdirectory and its contents can then be moved directly from the staging area to the target directory to complete the move.
\vspace{-5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\dirsep ion\dirsep pCT\_data\dirsep$\dots$ }}\color{Black} : This directory is where the raw, preprocessed, projection, and reconstruction data/images are moved to make them available to the other pCT users.  Each type of data is stored in separate subdirectories and soft links to this data are created and organized in a directory hierarchy indicating their input/output data dependencies.  The directory/file naming and organizational scheme for each type of data and the soft links are outlined in the next section of this document.  Data/images should only be moved to this shared directory after having been verified as valid/accurate and having been organized appropriately.
\vspace{-5mm}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\dirsep ion\dirsep pCT\_code\dirsep $\dots$ }}\color{Black} : This directory contains the code/programs used to generate simulated pCT data, preprocess raw experimental data, reconstruct images from experimental/simulated data, and tools for analyzing reconstructed images.  This directory also contains the code/program which calculates the water equivalent depth (WED) for a given list of beam angles and beam aim point (BAP) coordinates using the reconstructed RSP values for the target volume.  Each type of program and the corresponding code are stored in separate directories, and for each of these directories there is a ``\textit{master}'' directory containing the code/program that should be used/executed by users.  Each of these directories also contains separate subdirectories for each user involved in the development of the corresponding program and as a subdirectory of \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{$\dots$\dirsep ion}}\color{Black}, this code is then accessible by other users involved in the development of this program, making collaboration with them easier.  Ideally, everyone will manage their code/software development with something like GitHub in which case they could develop code from their personal directory and make their code available to collaborators through GitHub, but this is not a strict requirement (just a strong suggestion).  In cases where there are multiple versions of a program being developed completely separately (as is the case with the preprocessing code and the old/new reconstruction code), there should be a ``\textit{master}'' version for each of these in separate subdirectories with names making these discernable.\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\flushleft\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\\\dirsep ion\dirsep pCT\_data\dirsep pCT\_Documentation\dirsep $\dots$ }}\color{Black} : Documentation relevant to pCT is stored in this directory, such as descriptions of the data format, coordinate system, and phantoms and pCT related publications (including student theses/dissertations).  This is a GitHub managed local repository allowing everyone to ``push'' contributions to the repository and ``pull'' updates/additions from others into their own local clone ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.\\

Administrators can then follow the path downward until either the data's target directory is reached or
For example, data from a new run date should be organized in the staging area in a hierarchy of directories including all parent directories ( object name, simulated/experimental scan type, run date) below \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion}}\color{Black} such that the hierarchy of directories below \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion\dirsep staging\dirsep\usernamelabel\dirsep$\dots$}}\color{Black} mirrors the path to its target location.  The administrator can then follow the target path downward from \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion}}\color{Black} creating any directories that do not already exist and moving the data/code into their corresponding target directories.  For example, when data from a new run date is moved to the staging area, it should be organized in the hierarchy of directories corresponding to the object, scan type, run date, run \#, etc.  If data already exists for this object, this folder will already exist and need not be created.  If it is the first data set for a particular object, then the administrator can simply move the entire object folder and its contents to the target path and the

downward through directories that already exist along the target path and create those that do not and copy the data and any folders

data/code in the staging directory so the administrator can .

and other PDF documents.   so they need only locate the corresponding directory in the shared directories and will simply move files from the staging area to the appropriate shared directory the files in the staging area must be organized properly so an administrator can determine which shared directory it should be moved to.  Administrators typically will not be familiar with pCT or the organizational scheme

It is important to organize the data/code added to the staging area prior to contacting an administrator to move it to a shared directory Prior to contacting an administrator to move When a user is ready to share data with the other pCT users, it should be moved to this directory and a member of the ``\textit{ionadm}'' group will move this to the appropriate shared directory.  This data must be organized according to the format outlined in this document for data of this type.
