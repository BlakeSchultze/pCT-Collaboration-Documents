\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'[title=\dirsep ion\dirsep$\dots$]%<18.9cm><0.0cm>
	$\boldsymbol{-}$ This directory is dedicated to the storage of all code and data associated 		with proton and ion therapy research.  Private user data/code and data/code shared with the collaboration are both stored in subdirectories of this directory, but to prevent shared data from being overwritten and avoid disorganization, users cannot add data/code to the shared data directory themselves, an administrator must do it.  Data/code to be shared must first be added to the staging area (\textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep staging\dirsep\usernamelabel}}\color{Black}) and organized according to the organizational scheme for pCT data so an administrator can determine the appropriate destination directory and move it there.  Administrators typically will not be familiar with the organizational scheme which is why it must be organized according to its destination so an administrator can simply move the relevant files/folders to the corresponding shared data directory.\\\par
	
\indent\indent The data in this directory is located on a network storage device and this drive is mounted on both the Kodiak and Tardis clusters, making it accessible from all of the master/compute nodes.  To prevent a permanent loss of data in the event of drive failure, the contents of this directory are periodically backed up to tape drive.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'%
[title=\dirsep ion\dirsep home\dirsep\usernamelabel\dirsep$\dots$]
$\boldsymbol{-}$ This is a user's private home directory where the files associated with their account are stored (e.g., \texttt{.bash\_profile}, \texttt{.bash\_history}, etc.)  and is the default directory a user will find themselves after logging in.  Each user only has access to their personal directory, but because it is on the network storage device, it can be accessed from each of the Kodiak/Tardis nodes. Now that the home directories have been moved to \coloredtext{documentation-constdir}{\textbf{\dirsep ion}}, they no longer have a limited storage capacity, so users may run code and write the resulting output data/images to this directory.  Note that as a subdirectory of \coloredtext{documentation-constdir}{\textbf{\dirsep ion}}, the data in this directory will automatically be backed up to tape drive so it is recoverable in case of data corruption or drive failure.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% /data/<username>/... %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'[title=\dirsep data\dirsep\usernamelabel\dirsep$\dots$]
$\boldsymbol{-}$ This is the global home directory of each user which can be used input/output data for code/program execution and all permanent/important personal data should be stored.  As a subdirectory of \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep data}}\color{Black}, the contents of these directories are backed up periodically, but like the local home directories, each user only has access to their personal directory.%\parnoskip

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ion/incoming/<username> %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'[title=\dirsep ion\dirsep incoming\dirsep\usernamelabel\dirsep$\dots$]
$\boldsymbol{-}$ This is the directory where users should upload data/code to the Baylor server prior to preparing and organizing it for sharing with the collaboration, with each user only having access to their personal directory in \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep incoming}}\color{Black}.  When a user is ready to share data/code, it should be moved to their directory in the staging area and an administrator will move it to the appropriate shared directory.
\end{tcbparagraph}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ion/staging/<username> %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'[title=\dirsep ion\dirsep staging\dirsep\usernamelabel\dirsep$\dots$]
$\boldsymbol{-}$ This is the directory where users move data/code they wish to share with the collaboration, at which point an administrator will move the data from the staging area to the appropriate shared directory.  Since the administrators are not familiar with pCT or its organizational scheme, it is important for users to organize the data/code prior to adding it to the staging area so an administrator can easily determine and move the data to the appropriate shared directory.\\\par

\indent\indent In particular, users should create the entire target hierarchy of shared subdirectories below \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion} }\color{Black} inside the staging area.  The administrator can then follow these hierarchies downward until encountering a subdirectory in the staging area hierarchy that does not currently exist in the target shared directory, at which point they can simply move this subdirectory and its contents from the staging area to the target shared directory.  The subdirectories of the target shared directory that already exist must still be created and included in the staging area hierarchy so the directory hierarchies in the staging area and target shared directory are identical below \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion} }\color{Black} and \textbf{\color{DarkGreen}{\dirsep ion\dirsep incoming\dirsep\usernamelabel}}\color{Black}, respectively, providing the administrator with the target data path and required organizational framework and prevents the need to create/name/organize subdirectories.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'[title=\dirsep ion\dirsep pCT\_data\dirsep$\dots$]
$\boldsymbol{-}$ This directory is where the raw, preprocessed, projection, and reconstruction data/images are moved to make them available to the other pCT users.  Each type of data is stored in separate subdirectories and soft links to this data are created and organized in a directory hierarchy indicating their input/output data dependencies.  The directory/file naming and organizational scheme for each type of data and the soft links are outlined in the next section of this document.  Data/images should only be moved to this shared directory after having been verified as valid/accurate and having been organized appropriately.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ion/pCT_code/... %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'[title=\dirsep ion\dirsep pCT\_code\dirsep $\dots$]
$\boldsymbol{-}$ This directory is used to store permanent and semi-permanent pCT source code, from data acquisition to image reconstruction and analysis of reconstructed images.  It contains clones of GitHub repositories as well as user's personal versions of programs they want to make available to other users (otherwise users should keep their code in their private directories) organized by program type (Preprocessing/Reconstruction/etc.) with subdirectories for each user.
\end{tcbparagraph}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ion/pCT_code/git/<GitHub account>/<GitHub repo>/... %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'[title=\dirsep ion\dirsep pCT\_code\dirsep git\dirsep $<$\emph{GitHub account}$>$\dirsep $\dots$]
$\boldsymbol{-}$ This directory contains clones of the available pCT GitHub accounts and repositories, with parent directories for each GitHub account and subdirectories for each of their repositories.  Each program repository has a \coloredtext{documentation-dir}{master} branch, which typically corresponds to the current release version though there may also be a branch like \coloredtext{documentation-dir}{release} used instead, and each of the program's developers will typically have their own branch which they can use to develop and test new ideas/features.  The group of developers of a program should decide amongst themselves what the process will be for approving merges with the \coloredtext{documentation-dir}{master/release} branch and when to release a new version of the program, which may include the results of several separate merges.\\\par

Users accessing the \coloredtext{documentation-dir}{master/release} branch of these clones should execute \tcbinlinebashbox!{git pull --rebase} prior to using the code to ensure it is updated to its latest version.  \textbf{NOTE: This should not be done for other branches or the personal versions of code}.

\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'[title=\dirsep ion\dirsep pCT\_code\dirsep $<$\emph{Preprocessing/Reconstruction}$>$\dirsep\usernamelabel\dirsep$\dots$]
$\boldsymbol{-}$ These Preprocessing/Reconstruction/etc. directories contain subdirectories for each user which they can use to store their personal versions of programs and make these available to other users.  These may or may not be local clones of an existing repository, but users should only store their code here if they want it to be available to other users, otherwise they should store it in one of their private directories.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{tcbparagraph}'tcbBlueStyle'[title=\dirsep ion\dirsep pCT\_data\dirsep pCT\_Documentation\dirsep $\dots$]
$\boldsymbol{-}$ Documentation relevant to pCT is stored in this directory, such as descriptions of the data format, coordinate system, and phantoms and pCT related publications (including student theses/dissertations).  This is a GitHub managed local repository allowing everyone to ``push'' contributions to the repository and ``pull'' updates/additions from others into their own local clone ensuring everyone has access to the latest information.
